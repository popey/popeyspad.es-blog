Got a bit bored during the Great Lockdown of 2020 and found myself playing a bit of OpenSpades. One thing led to another, and I decided to spin up a server, create a discord and register a domain. So here we are.

You’ll find my server “Good Vs Evil” in the list, and can ‘favourite’ it with a right click of the mouse. Maybe I’ll see you there.
