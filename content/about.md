OpenSpades
==========

OpenSpades is an Open Source Voxel first-person shooter. The source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/yvt/openspades) where there are [releases](https://github.com/yvt/openspades/releases) for Windows and MacOS. I help maintain a snap of OpenSpades, which you can get from the Snap Store.

piqueserver
===========

piqueserver is an Open Source server based on PySnip. The source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/piqueserver/piqueserver) and has [documentation](https://piqueserver.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in case you’d like to run your own server.

popey spades
============

popeyspades is basically my own public server, running piqueserver, which I connect to with OpenSpades and play on with friends and random people on the Internet.

Like many people, I have enjoyed playing OpenSpades for some years. I like choosing the map I want to play on, but there’s not a huge number of servers out there, and many run maps I don’t want to play on, or are empty.

So was born my popey spades server. A place where I can play, and invite others to play too.
