Got a bit bored during the _Great Lockdown of 2020_ and found myself playing a bit of [OpenSpades](https://snapcraft.io/openspades). One thing led to another, and I decided to spin up a server, create a [discord](/discord) and register a [domain](https://popeyspad.es). So here we are.

You’ll find my server “**Good Vs Evil**” in the list, and can ‘favourite’ it with a right click of the mouse. Maybe I’ll see you there.

Most servers have “blue” and “green” teams, or words in polish I don’t understand. I named the teams “_Good_” and “_Evil_” and coloured the characters white and black. I’ve put a few maps on the server that I personally like playing, and made it public.

Over the last week or so there’s been plenty of times where the server hits the 32-player maximum. It’s a fun game, _toxic player chat and cheaters aside_. I find it a great way to escape the world around me, dig tunnels, build barriers, and shoot people on the Internet. :)
