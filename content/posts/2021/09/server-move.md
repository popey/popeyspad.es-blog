The popeyspades instances have moved!

Goodbye ~~Linode~~ Akami, hello Hetzner!

You shouldn't (currently) notice any difference because I copied the entire configuration, maps, bans and admins over. 

The only thing you may notice is the fact we've moved hosting from USA to Germany. That might be a problem as lag for some of the South American players, we shall see.

There are some changes coming though, more on that in a later post, another day.
